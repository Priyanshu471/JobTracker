# JobTracker 
It is the telegram bot that can run a job search for a particular company and give you the links as the response.
I created this for my learning and understanding of how a telegram bot works. 
I first created its HLD sort of diagram for understanding and implemented it later.

# Links
* [JobFinder](https://t.me/ur_jobfinderbot).

# Technology used
* Javascript.
* NodeJs.
* ExpressJs.
* MongoDB.

# Future goals
* I have to implement its feature for daily updates for subscribers which can be achievable by using cron.
* I will add more companies to the list.
* I will make its user experience & interaction better.
